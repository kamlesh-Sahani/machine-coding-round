## About the Projects

This repository includes implementations of coding challenges from machine coding rounds aimed at assessing programming skills in web development. Each project tackles different real-world scenarios and problems that a full-stack developer might face.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** - Core logic and algorithms.
- **React.js** - For building user interfaces and single-page applications.
- **Next.js** - For server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Express.js** - Backend framework to handle API routes.
- **MongoDB** - Database for MERN stack projects.
- **Node.js** - Backend runtime environment.

## Installation

To clone the repository and set it up locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kamlesh-Sahani/machine-coding-round.git
cd /machine-coding-round
```

## Project Setup

Each project is in its own folder with individual instructions. For example:

1. **For React or Next.js Projects:**
    ```bash
    cd project-folder-name
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
2. **For MERN Stack Projects:**
    - Backend:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      npm install
      npm start
      ```
    - Frontend:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm install
      npm start
      ```
